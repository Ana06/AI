## Travel recommender
This rule-based system suggests the most suitable voyage given the characteristics of the user and the destinations. 

The database is implemented using the deffacts constructor and the recommendations are possible with the usage of Jess rules. In order to execute the system you can use [this plugin for Eclipse](http://www.jessrules.com/doc/70/eclipse.html).

**TravelRecommendationReport.pdf** is a report of the project in Spanish.
