# AI

Several projects for the Artificial Intelligence course, with topics such as Recommender and Rule-based Systems, Ontologies and Natural Language Processing. This project was done during a university course (Artificial intelligence) and finished in June 2015.


## Natural Language Processing - Prolog

Natural Language Processing in Prolog. The project consists in a personal agenda with a natural language interface. If you'd like to use it, you may use [swi-prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/) for example.

**DiaryReport.pdf** is a report of the project in Spanish.


## Travel recommender

This rule-based system suggests the most suitable voyage given the characteristics of the user and the destinations. 

The database is implemented using the deffacts constructor and the recommendations are possible with the usage of Jess rules. In order to execute the system you can use [this plugin for Eclipse](http://www.jessrules.com/doc/70/eclipse.html).

**TravelRecommendationReport.pdf** is a report of the project in Spanish.

## Ontology - Protégé

We propose an ontology about the domain of touristic journeys. Several instances are included so you can make queries. In order to play with the ontology you need [Protégé](http://protege.stanford.edu/).


## Travel recommender - Protégé-Jess

Integration of the previous ontology with the rule-based system in Jess to provide a more complex recommender system.
